# Security Alert: Potential Email Breach

Hi Team,

I wanted to inform you that I’ve recently discovered unauthorized access to my email account, which may have resulted in someone viewing or following some of our project threads. I am currently taking immediate steps to secure my account, including changing passwords and updating security settings.

**Action Items:**
- Please be vigilant for any unusual or suspicious communication that appears to come from me.
- If you receive any unusual requests, verify directly with me before taking action.
- Let me know right away if you notice any issues regarding project communications or access.

Despite this, I am continuing to work on the Coin_TOP-Carbon-Credit- project as planned.

Thank you for your understanding and vigilance.

Best,  
Joel
